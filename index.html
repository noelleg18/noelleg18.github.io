    <h2>Effects of Ignorance of Neurodivergence</h2>

    <p>The very concept of mentally ill people being incompetent to exact their autonomy and make choices for themselves or even have opinions stems from the ignorance and neurotypical centralized functioning of our world. People who struggle with illness(es) of varying severity and classifications are often damned, grouped into one very constricting category by uninformed, unsympathetic individuals. Those who fall into the neurotypical category often consider themselves to be more sensible, reliable, and even intelligent on the basis of ignorance and lack of an irrefutable science. And as history has shown unfortunately ignorance often leads to fear, and fear, leads to hate. So many mentally ill people have suffered unimaginable pain of all kinds throughout history, being dismissed, homeless, and abused. The world is not built to accommodate those who suffer mental handicaps.</p>

    <h2>Trauma and Recovery</h2>

    <p>A quote on the first page of Judith Lewis Herman's book, Trauma and Recovery, strikes me to my core. She states that “Observers who have never experienced prolonged terror and who have no understanding of coercive methods of control presume that they would show greater courage and resistance than the victim and similar circumstances.” This effect does not only extend to outsiders but to the abusers themselves. There is such a confusing paradox that the abuser doesn’t believe that the abused would allow such treatment to transpire, but when the abused attempts to defend themselves, they are further punished. This belittlement of the effect of the trauma on the abused by the abuser is simply another form of gaslighting that deeply affects the psyche of the abused, their trust in themselves, their trust in their abuser, and therefore in reality and life itself. Outside of this when they are belittled by those who are 1. Not them and 2. Have not experienced such trauma, it only further draws out the anger, shame, and over mental peril that they experienced from their abuser. Unfortunately, many people who have not been traumatized have a much lower threshold for empathy, and boasting about one's higher strength out of ignorance is a huge damper on the healing of those who have suffered.

    <h2>Neglect of Mental Health in Favor of Physical Health</h2>

    <p>As mentioned in the interview with Judy I believe the fawning, or freezing response is one that often goes unnoticed or unaddressed. It is one that I experienced the most growing up with a narcissistic mother. It is what happens when you are not allowed to leave but are also prohibited from fighting, and it often leads to dissociation or more severely derealization. I believe that the core reason our world continues to circulate and transfer trauma is an issue of lack of self-awareness and selfishness. Self-awareness can come from experiencing the absence of someone else’s or it can be innate, it is often hindered by ego and fear, both derived from selfishness. When someone neglects to identify a problem with themself, no improvements can be made. Unfortunately, often health worsens, and others are traumatized as a result. I also believe that one enormous neglect that exists in this world is the lack of understanding that mental illness leads to physical symptoms as well. Mental health already is given much less attention than physical health, and even more so the effects of it on the body. So not only is mental health ignored, but the resulting physical illness is completely neglected. It seems like humans praise our own high level of intelligence and all the benefits of it, but we seem to ignore the fact that it also has many negative effects. In order to help someone struggling with trauma who is unaware or opposed to addressing it, you must understand its origin, and where they come from. The approach must be very sensitive, it is preferential to avoid labels to prevent the effects of stigma. And most importantly emotional safety and lack of judgment must be established in order to counteract defensiveness.</p>
